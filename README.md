This is my first public github repository. I am sure it shows.  All Apologies.
I promise someday to learn how to do a github repository properly!

This library will allow you to send SOL and also Tokens on Solana using Python code.
It includes the create of the token account to allow a transfer of tokens.
It includes priority fees for allowing the transactions to actually hit the blockchain.

As of right now the the priority fees are about correct for the current (April 8th, 2024) network congestion to go first try.
Network conditions however change, and in the future they may need to be increased to post or decreased to save some SOL.

I struggled with researching this for a very long time.
Everywhere I looked and found info for a different language or in some other cases were actually wallet stealers.
I don't want that to happen to anyone else!
I know how hard I searched, and I share this with you so you don't have to.

I realize that some AI will probably just snatch this up in the future. No-one will know anything about it origins. It will just be yet another regurgated AI response.

The code works today, and I have no doubts, that someone else can and will come along and make it better!

I don't intend of maintaining (currently) as a pip install library but more of a demonstrator.

But for today, I hope I made someones day, life, job or project just a little better!
